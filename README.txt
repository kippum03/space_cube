* Project Description

* Description
-------------
The game will be played in third person in which the player is spawned onto a black cube in space setting. 
The objective of the game is to stay on the black cube for as long as possible, and the score is determined by the survival time.
The game spawns planets that will fall on the cube which will, if hit, knock the player back.
The black cube will also rotate at random.
